# Micro-sevices architecture

The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms.

## Advantage of Micro-service architecture
- Very very small application that focusing on a single thing
- Independent application
- Individual team can work on it
- Easy to scalable

## Micorseverces Architecture vs Monolithlic Architecture

**Monolithic Architecture** - A monolithic application is built as a single and indivisible unit. Usually, such a solution comprises a client-side user interface, a server side-application, and a database.

**Microservices Architecture** - A Microservices architecture breaks it down into a collection of smaller independent units. These units carry out every application process as a separate service. So all the services have their own logic and the database as well as perform the specific functions.
