## KUBERNETES

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- Developed by **google**.
- It facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
- Large rapidly growing ecosystem.
- It is also known as `K8s` or `K8`.

### Benefits of Kubernetes

- Automates Containerized Environments
- Easy to Scale Up and Down
- Can be Run Anywhere
- Multi Cloud

### Installation

We can install kubernets from docker desktop settings.

### Kubernetes Pods

A Kubernetes pod is a collection of one or more LinuxÂ® containers, and is the smallest unit of a Kubernetes application. 

- A pod containes a single container.
- A pod can also be composed of multiple, tightly coupled containers for advanced use case.
- containers in the same pod will share the same compute resources.

### Kubernetes Service

Kubernetes Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. It is a REST object in the API that we define in a manifest file and post to the API server.

- It is a very crucial component in Kubernetes as it lets us expose an application running in Pods to be reachable from outside your cluster.

## Common Commands

### Display the Service
```
kubectl get service
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   25h

kubectl get svc  # short form for service - same result
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   25h
```

### Delete a Service
```
$ kubectl delete svc nginx-svc
service "nginx-svc" deleted
```

### Display Deployment
```
$ kubectl get deployment # Currently we get- no resource found in default namespace - as nothing is deployed yet
No resources found in default namespace.

$ kubectl get deploy # same as above
No resources found in default namespace.
```

### Delete Deployments
```
$ kubectl delete deploy nginx-deployment
deployment.apps "nginx-deployment" deleted
```

### Display Pods
```
$ kubectl get pods # Shows the pods # We don't have any yet
No resources found in default namespace.
```
